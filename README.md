# How It Works
1. Search Functionality
  . The user inputs a search term in the search bar, and the searchBooks() function is triggered.
  . The function sends a request to the Open Library API to fetch books matching the search term and displays the results.
  . The category filter is used to refine the results further by appending a category query parameter to the API request.
2. Search Suggestions
  . As the user types, the fetchSuggestions() function fetches real-time suggestions from the Open Library API.
  . These suggestions are displayed dynamically in a dropdown beneath the search input, allowing users to click and directly select a book.
3. Display Books
  . Books are displayed in a scrollable container, with a thumbnail image, title, and author.
  . Clicking on a book opens a popup window with more detailed information, such as the book's description, publish year, and edition count.
4. Error Handling
  . If no results are found or an error occurs when fetching data, a custom error page is shown with a "Try Again" button to reload the page.
  . If there are issues with fetching book details, the application gracefully handles the error without crashing.
5. Responsive Layout
  . The application uses flexbox and other CSS techniques to ensure the layout is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.
6. Navigation
  . Navigation buttons allow users to scroll left or right through the list of books. The scroll position is monitored, and buttons are shown or hidden based on the scroll state.

# Customization
You can customize the application by:

  . Changing the default search query in the searchBooks() function.
  . Modifying the available categories in the category dropdown.
  . Updating the design by editing the style.css file.
